# Semistructured

## Objects and Arrows

We introduce the category, **SemiStruct**, to represent collections of semi-structured formats \(e.g., JSON, XML, RDF, GraphQL\) and transformations between them \(e.g., JSON to XML, XML to GraphQL\).

$$
Ob(SemiStruct) : Format \\
Hom(SemiStruct) : (Format \times Format)
