## Maana 101

This section is meant to provide a high-level introduction to the Maana Platform.  It introduces key concepts and language, and provides a brief overview of the training topics. 

In a nutshell, Maana is a platform for building an enterprise-wide **knowledge** layer for search, exploration, and solution development and delivery.

### Knowledge and Computational Models

**Knowledge** is an answer to a question. A knowledge layer is _not just a relational database or data warehouse view_ of a complex business.  It is about things - their properties, and complex, dynamic relationships.

We represent such knowledge through _structural_ and _computational_ models.  
Vessel Cargo vs. Vessel ETA.  A problem question is of the form:   
Given **X**, what is **Y**?    
This is also just finding a **function f:X**: → **Y**

### Maana Application and Users

#### Who uses Maana?

The Maana platform is used by **solutions teams** to deliver **knowledge applications** to their end users \(i.e., business users, SMEs, managers\). 

The Maana **solution team approach** involves the collaboration of: 

* Analysts
* Engineers
* Data scientists

The Maana platform supports this collaboration using a simple process of **problem decomposition**. The Maana **Knowledge Portal** provides a shared environment for visual and programmatic development of a solution.

### The Maana Solution

Maana solutions take a knowledge-centric approach to modeling and reasoning about various interconnected problem domains.  

Maana solutions generally follow a simple pattern:

* Observe the problem domain.
* Reason over the problem domain to make \(explicable\) recommendations.
* Decide \(assist the user\) with what action to take.
* Learn from the outcome of the decision in order to make better recommendations

#### Real World Examples

1. Given a set of invoices, what is the optimal collection plan?
2. Given a set of malware victims, who are the most vulnerable likely victims?
3. Given a patient history and a patient condition, what is the most relevant history?
4. Given a set of Bitcoin wallets, what are the most likely fraudulent transactions?
5. Given a customer equipment failure, what is the recommended repair action?
6. Given a set of insurance claims, which are most likely fraudulent?
7. Given a job activity, what are the relevant Health & Safety considerations?

**Composing** and **Reusing** Models and Solutions offers the Maana user:

* **Predictive Maintenance:**  Planned Maintenance, Supply Chain Optimization
* **Trade Finance:**  Shipping and Port Operations
* **Upstream**:  Planning, Production and Capital Allocations
