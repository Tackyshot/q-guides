# Curating Kinds in the CKG

## Curating Kinds in the Computational Knowledge Graph \(CKG\)

As a best practice, once an initial CKG has been created from one or more uploaded files, we recommend that the Business Analyst follows a curation process to visualize and validate the kinds and the suggested relations among them.  This should be performed to identify and correct any unintended errors that would otherwise propagate downstream, and negatively impact decision-making. 

It is recommended that the Business Analyst do a quick inspection of each of the Maana-generated interpreted kinds to:  

* Rename the Kind for ease-of-use. 
* Validate/modify the Field Classifications suggested by the Maana bots.
* Validate/modify suggested Relations between Kinds or Entities within a Kind. 

As a user, I want to be able to view the results of the entity extractor bot aka extracted entities for the following purposes: 

* get a high level, summarized view of the results using the appropriate viz 
* be able to click on the relevant Kind and see extracted results in the context of the selected Kind 
* workspace 1 - running entity extraction on K: text remark produces instances in K: Person, K: Org and K: Location 
* within ws 1 or create workspace 2 - running entity extraction on K: text remark\_2 produces additional instances inâ€¯K: Person, K: Org and K: Location 
* i want to see instances in K: Person, K: Org and K: Location filtered based on the source Kind\(s\) selected 
* be able to remove or change labels as needed 
* be able to look at the instances of a Kind and know which ones are sourced from files/documents vs classifier generated
