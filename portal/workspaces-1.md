# Workspaces

## Workspaces

After you have had an opportunity to navigate around the **HOME** screen and investigate some of the areas and **Tutorials** made available for your use, your first step in utilizing the power of the Knowledge Graph is opening a Workspace.  You can either go to the **Quick Starts** area of your screen and select **Create a New Workspace** \(if you want to set up a new one\),  or access existing, shared or templates for Workspaces by simply selecting the **WORKSPACES** tab in the ribbon at the top of your screen.

### Dedicated Areas

Workspaces are dedicated areas within the Maana Portal where users such as yourself can build, visualize and explore the refined data generated within Computational Knowledge Graphs \(CKG\).

In the upper left of your display, is the **My Workspaces** area of the screen.

Any Workspaces that have been created previously, either by yourself \(or people in Groups within your organization that have included you\), will be visible here.  You may simply select one to open it and view the CKG.

Directly beneath **My Workspaces** is the **Shared Workspaces** area.

This area displays Workspaces that multiple users share within your organization which you are permitted to access.

Beneath **Shared Workspaces** is the **Workspaces Templates** area.

Use the templates found here as a basis to quickly build and customize new templates for your use.
