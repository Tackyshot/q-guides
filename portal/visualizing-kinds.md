# Visualizing Kinds

### Visualizing Kinds

Maana Kinds appear in 2 different forms within the Computational Knowledge Graph: 

1. **Compact**
2. **Expanded**â€¯ 

#### Compact Representation  of an Interpreted Kind

The **Compact Representation** of a Kind contains the following elements:  

* Kind name 
* IN-Relations connector at the Kind level - Shows incoming relations into the Kind.  

![Example of IN - Relation Connector at the Kind level](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image021.png)

* OUT-Relations connector at the kind level - Shows outgoing relations/dependencies TO other Kinds.

**Note**:  The **Down** arrow located in the center at the bottom of the screen \(see above example\), when selected,  changes the representation of the Kind from Compact to the Expanded mode.  The way the Kind is presented in the canvas space _does not_ affect its functionality. 
{% endhint %}

#### Expanded Representation of an Interpreted Kind

The Expanded Representation of a Kind includes the following elements:  

* Kind name 
* **IN** - Relations connector at the Kind level - Shows incoming relations into the kind.  
* **OUT** -- Relations connector at the kind level - Shows outgoing relations/dependencies TO other kinds. 
* List of Entities within that Kind. 
* **IN** - Relations connector at the Entity level - Shows incoming relations into the Kind or Entities within those kinds.

* **OUT**-Relations Connector at the Entity level - Shows outgoing Relations/Dependencies TO other Kinds or Entities within those Kinds.

**Note**:  The **Up** arrow **^** located in the center at the bottom of the screen \(see above example\), when selected,  changes the representation of the Kind from Expanded to the Compact mode.  The way the Kind is presented in the canvas space _does not_ affect its functionality.

#### Visualizing a Kind

To visualize a Kind, you need to bring it into focus first. That can be done by:  

* Selecting the Kind in the **Canvas** area.  
* Selecting the Kind from the list in the **Explorer** or **Inventory** panel.

In the bottom panel below the **Canvas**, the user can:  

* Preview the Kind 
* View a summary of a  Kind
