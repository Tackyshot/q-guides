# Knowledge Portal User Guide

## Introduction

### Welcome to Maana

Maana was founded with the vision of using technology to systematize the world’s industrial expertise and data into digital knowledge that could significantly advance the global economy. Our mission is to facilitate the tens of millions of experts working in industrial companies around the world, and give them the ability to make better decisions, faster. We are devoted to putting the power of artificial intelligence \(AI\) into the hands of millions of industry experts, offering enhanced decision-making tools in a rapid response environment.

### Better and Faster

In 2013 Maana invented a new way to represent industrial knowledge mathematically, using the patented Maana Computational Knowledge Graph™. This unique technology enables industrial companies to take human expertise and data from across silos and encode it into digital knowledge, eliminating the need to move data and enabling the creation of thousands of models at scale, through the re-usability of models across the enterprise.  

### Scope

This guide is intended for the use of Business Analysts within the organizations and client companies of Maana, Inc.

### Glossary

Prior to working with the Maana Platform, it is suggested that you familiarize yourself with some basic terms and concepts that will help the make most out of your Maana portal experience. For a complete Glossary of Terms, please refer to the [Glossary](https://confluence.corp.maana.io/display/MAANA/Maana+Glossary#app-switcher) section of the Maana Corporate site.

## Maana 101

In a nutshell, Maana is a platform for building an enterprise-wide **knowledge** layer for search, exploration, and solution development and delivery.

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/Maana%20Gear%20human%20plus%20data%20final%20copy.png)

### Knowledge and Computational Models

**Knowledge** is an answer to a question. A knowledge layer is _not just a relational database or data warehouse view_ of a complex business.  It is about things - their properties, and complex, dynamic relationships.

We represent such knowledge through _structural_ and _computational_ models:  
  
Vessel Cargo vs. Vessel ETA.  A problem question is of the form:   
Given **X**, what is **Y**?    
This is also just finding a **function f:X**: → **Y**  
Composition: &=\(\(ℎ!+\)

### Maana Application and Users

#### Who uses Maana?

The Maana platform is used by **solutions teams** to deliver **knowledge applications** to their end users \(i.e., business users, SMEs, managers\) such as yourselves.   Our knowledge platform uses a simple process of **problem decomposition**, and our **Knowledge Portal** provides a shared environment for visual and programmatic development of a solution for you, the end user.

### The Maana Solution

Maana solutions take a knowledge-centric approach to modeling and reasoning about various interconnected problem domains. Maana solutions generally follow a simple pattern:

* Observe the problem domain.
* Reason over the problem domain to make \(explicable\) recommendations.
* Decide \(assist the user\) with what action to take.
* Learn from the outcome of the decision in order to make better recommendations

#### Real World Examples

Real world examples of the knowledge solutions we provide to you might include the following examples:

1. Given a set of invoices, what is the optimal collection plan?
2. Given a set of malware victims, who are the most vulnerable likely victims?
3. Given a patient history and a patient condition, what is the most relevant history?
4. Given a set of Bitcoin wallets, what are the most likely fraudulent transactions?
5. Given a customer equipment failure, what is the recommended repair action?
6. Given a set of insurance claims, which are most likely fraudulent?
7. Given a job activity, what are the relevant Health & Safety considerations?

**Composing** and **Reusing** Models and Solutions offers you, the Maana end user:

* **Predictive Maintenance:**  Planned Maintenance, Supply Chain Optimization
* **Trade Finance:**  Shipping and Port Operations
* **Upstream**:  Planning, Production and Capital Allocations

#### Closing an Existing Workspace:

Go to the **Workspaces** tab in the horizontal menu at the top of the screen and select a workspace name in the secondary horizontal menu.  Select the minus sign to the right of the list of workspace names.

### Working within a Workspace 

The workspace features several areas with specific functionality that enables the user to create, manage, visualize and explore Knowledge Graphs and their components.

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image007.png)

#### Explorer Panel Area

The Explorer Panel area of the screen is used to:

* Create or clone a new Knowledge Graph.
* Query a Knowledge Graph.
* Upload a file or a group of files to create or enhance a Knowledge Graph.
* Create a new Query.

#### The Canvas Area

The Canvas area of the screen is used to:

* Drag and Drop files to create/enhance a Knowledge Graph.
* Create or Delete Kinds.
* Curate existing Kinds and the connections between them.
* Visualize and manually explore the Knowledge Graph.

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image008.png)

#### The Context Panel 

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image009.png)

There are  number of Tabs on the **Context Panel**:

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image010.png)

The Inventory Panel contains an inventory of Micro Services, Files and Kinds used in the workspace.

#### The Visualization Panel

The Visualization Panel allows the user to visualize Kinds and data associated with those Kinds like Instances, Entities and Values.  Raw Data Kinds can be explored quickly using the visualization panel, as each entity detected in the data file can be filtered using a “search as you type” capability.

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image011.png)

The visualization panel can also be used to query a Knowledge Graph using GraphQL \(refer to example provided below\).

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image012.png)

## Platform Capabilities

### The Computational Knowledge Graph

The Maana Computational Knowledge Graph™ \(CKG\) is a network of models that optimize specific operations and decisions flows, by providing recommendations through AI-Driven Applications. This unique technology eliminates the need to move data - and enables creation of thousands of models at scale, through the re-usability of models across the enterprise.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example**:  A working, real-world example of a CKG might be a Knowledge Graph that contains a network of models describing the oil wells dug in the Gulf of Mexico during the last 50 years - including companies, people, equipment and activities involved, etc.
{% endhint %}

### CKG Key Components

| **Term** | **Description** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Kinds | Kinds are Concepts. | Examples: People, Ships, Oil Wells, Invoices   |
| Fields/Entities | Entities are properties within a certain Concept. | Such as entities related to the People concept: age, sex, height, weight, etc. |
| Instances |  A particular set of values for Entities within a Concept. | Such as:  Paul, 40yrs old, male, 6', 180 pounds |
| Values | A particular size, measure, number of an Entity. | Example of a value: 40Example of an instance: Paul, 40yrs old, male, 6', 180pounds |
| Relations | Connections/dependencies that can be established between fields belonging to different Kinds. | A Kind describing an oil well may contain a field of a type of a String showing the name of the company operating that well.  That field has a relation with the Kind containing Company Names. |
| Microservice/  Bots | Microservices are processes that communicate with each other over a network to fulfill a goal using technology-agnostic protocols such as HTTP.Organized around capabilities, e.g., user interface front-end, recommendation, logistics, billing, etc.Microservices can emit events \(act as publishers\) which trigger automatic action\(s\) from other services \(acting as subscribers\) that react to those events.Microservices are small in size, independently deployable and easy to replace. | Examples:  **io.maana.nlp** **service category**Named entity recognition \(NER\) microserviceDoc classification  **io.maana**.minerField classifier |
| String | any arbitrary length character sequence and is the most generic representation \(i.e. it has little meaning\)  |   |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip**:  Knowledge Accelerator Tip: check out our short Tutorial \(link to Tutorial doc\) with a specific, dataset-driven example on how you can create and explore a CKG. It will help you move much faster when you will create the first CKG from your own data!
{% endhint %}

### Loading Structured Data into Maana

To load structured data into Maana:

* Create or select the workspace where you want to load data. Go to the **Workspaces** tab and either create a Workspace or open a Shared Workspace/Template \(refer to the [Opening and Closing Existing Workspaces](workspaces/#opening-and-closing-existing-workspaces) area mentioned previously in the Workspaces section for more details as required\). 
* Select the **Upload File** button.  
* Select the file\(s\) you would like to add. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:  It is also possible to simply drag and drop files into the **Canvas** area to upload them into the current workspace.  The platform currently supports the CSV file format, with more file types to be supported in the near future. 
{% endhint %}

* The uploading file\(s\) will appear on the canvas while a **Progress** indicator in the Explorer tab shows that the file is being processed. 

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image014.png)

Following the completion of the upload process, the system will generate: 

* **Raw Data Kind**\(s\) – Data Kind representing files that were uploaded into Maana and their corresponding metadata.

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image015.png)

* **Interpreted Kind**\(s\)– Kinds generated from the Raw Data Kind following parsing by Maana  bots/microservices. 

Loading data into a **Raw Data Kind** triggers automatic parsing by Maana bots, resulting in the creation of an **Interpreted Kind**, and possibly other subsequent Kinds \(People Names, Company, etc.\) and connections between them, including: 

* **Field Classifications**:  Interpretations of individual fields and their values against known Kinds and Instances \(e.g., People, Places, Organizations, Categorical\).  

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example**:  The Field Classifier bot can suggest that an Entity called **Company Name** is of the type **Company**, where **Company** is a known Kind describing companies doing business in the US\). 
{% endhint %}

* **Entity Extraction**:  Analysis of comments, descriptions, or whole documents to identify mentions of entities, values, and facts. 

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image016.png)

**Interpreted Kinds** have a schemas including Entities that make up that Kind and their suggested Field Types - which can be detected by a Maana Field Classifier microservice as Generic Field Types \(i.e. String, Integer, etc.\) or as Kind Types.

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image017.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example**:  Interpreted Kinds appear in blue, with sample instances showing in the Visualization tab. 
{% endhint %}

* **Relations between Kinds** - Maana suggested Relations and/or Dependencies within the associative network. The Business Analyst can review and validate them as part of the Kind Visualization and Curation process.  

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image018.png)

Maana also offers the option to load multiple files via CLI.  See section “5.9 CLI capabilities” for instructions.  

### Loading Unstructured Data into MAANA  

The user can load unstructured data files into MAANA, following the same process used for Structured Data:  

* Create or select the Workspace where you want to load the data. 
* Go to the **Workspaces** tab and either:  
  * Create a Workspace or...
  * Open a Shared Workspace/Template \(refer to the [Opening  and Closing an Existing Workspace](workspaces/#opening-and-closing-existing-workspaces) area mentioned previously in the **Workspaces** section for more details as required\).

 
* Select the **Upload File** button
* Select the desired file\(s\). 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:  It is also possible to simply drag and drop files into the **Canvas** area to upload them into the current workspace.  The platform currently supports the TXT and PDF text file formats, with additional file types to be supported in the near future. 
{% endhint %}

#### Additional Bots and Microservices that Mine Unstructured Data

When unstructured data files are loaded, there are additional bots/microservices that mine the data.  This Entity Extraction includes:  

* Analysis of Comments
* Descriptions
* Whole documents used to identify mentions of:
  * Entities 
  * Values
  * Facts

The Extracted Entities will appear in the **Inventory** Tab, under the MAANA Entity Extractor service, together with information regarding the number of times instances of such entities were identified. The Business Analyst can drag one or all of the extracted Entities to the Canvas area of their screen, making them Kinds within the Knowledge Graph. 

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image019.png)

* **Text Classification**:  Classification of comments, descriptions, or whole documents into preferred groups \(e.g. Comment Problem types - Stuck pipe, Waiting on weather, etc. or Document types - AFE report or Lease Agreement\) – not available yet in UI. 

### Creating, Deleting or Renaming a Kind

TBA

### Visualizing Kinds

Maana Kinds appear in 2 different forms within the Computational Knowledge Graph: 

1. **Compact**
2. **Expanded**  

#### Compact Representation  of an Interpreted Kind 

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image020.png)

The **Compact Representation** of a Kind contains the following elements:  

* Kind name 
* IN-Relations connector at the Kind level - Shows incoming relations into the Kind.  

![Example of IN - Relation Connector at the Kind level](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image021.png)

* OUT-Relations connector at the kind level - Shows outgoing relations/dependencies TO other Kinds.

![Example of OUT - Relation Connector at the Kind level.](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image022.png)



{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:  The **Down** arrow located in the center at the bottom of the screen \(see above example\), when selected,  changes the representation of the Kind from Compact to the Expanded mode.  The way the Kind is presented in the canvas space _does not_ affect its functionality. 
{% endhint %}

#### Expanded Representation of an Interpreted Kind  

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image023.png)

The Expanded Representation of a Kind includes the following elements:  

* Kind name 
* **IN** - Relations connector at the Kind level - Shows incoming relations into the kind.  
* **OUT** -- Relations connector at the kind level - Shows outgoing relations/dependencies TO other kinds. 
* List of Entities within that Kind. 
* **IN** - Relations connector at the Entity level - Shows incoming relations into the Kind or Entities within those kinds. 

![](https://gitbooktrainingmaterials.blob.core.windows.net/images/image024.png)

* **OUT**-Relations Connector at the Entity level - Shows outgoing Relations/Dependencies TO other Kinds or Entities within those Kinds. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:  The **Up** arrow **^** located in the center at the bottom of the screen \(see above example\), when selected,  changes the representation of the Kind from Expanded to the Compact mode.  The way the Kind is presented in the canvas space _does not_ affect its functionality. 
{% endhint %}

#### Visualizing a Kind

To visualize a Kind, you need to bring it into focus first. That can be done by:  

* Selecting the Kind in the **Canvas** area.  
* Selecting the Kind from the list in the **Explorer** or **Inventory** panel.

In the bottom panel below the **Canvas**, the user can:  

* Preview the Kind 
* View a summary of a  Kind

## Curating Kinds in the Computational Knowledge Graph \(CKG\)

As a best practice, once an initial CKG has been created from one or more uploaded files, we recommend that the Business Analyst follows a curation process to visualize and validate the kinds and the suggested relations among them.  This should be performed to identify and correct any unintended errors that would otherwise propagate downstream, and negatively impact decision-making. 

It is recommended that the Business Analyst do a quick inspection of each of the Maana-generated interpreted kinds to:  

* Rename the Kind for ease-of-use. 
* Validate/modify the Field Classifications suggested by the Maana bots.
* Validate/modify suggested Relations between Kinds or Entities within a Kind. 

As a user, I want to be able to view the results of the entity extractor bot aka extracted entities for the following purposes: 

* get a high level, summarized view of the results using the appropriate viz 
* be able to click on the relevant Kind and see extracted results in the context of the selected Kind 
* workspace 1 - running entity extraction on K: text remark produces instances in K: Person, K: Org and K: Location 
* within ws 1 or create workspace 2 - running entity extraction on K: text remark\_2 produces additional instances in K: Person, K: Org and K: Location 
* i want to see instances in K: Person, K: Org and K: Location filtered based on the source Kind\(s\) selected 
* be able to remove or change labels as needed 
* be able to look at the instances of a Kind and know which ones are sourced from files/documents vs classifier generated
