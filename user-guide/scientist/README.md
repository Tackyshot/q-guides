In a nutshell, Maana is a platform for building an enterprise-wide **knowledge** layer for search, exploration, and solution development and delivery.

### Knowledge and Computational Models <a id="knowledge-and-computational-models"></a>

**Knowledge** is an answer to a question. A knowledge layer is _not just a relational database or data warehouse view_ of a complex business. It is about things - their properties, and complex, dynamic relationships.

We represent such knowledge through _structural_ and _computational_ models: Vessel Cargo vs. Vessel ETA. A problem question is of the form: Given **X**, what is **Y**? This is also just finding a **function f:X**: → **Y** Composition: &=\(\(ℎ!+\)

### Maana Application and Users <a id="maana-application-and-users"></a>

#### Who uses Maana? <a id="who-uses-maana"></a>

The Maana platform is used by **solutions teams** to deliver **knowledge applications** to their end users \(i.e., business users, SMEs, managers\) such as yourselves. Our knowledge platform uses a simple process of **problem decomposition**, and our **Knowledge Portal** provides a shared environment for visual and programmatic development of a solution for you, the end user.

### The Maana Solution <a id="the-maana-solution"></a>

Maana solutions take a knowledge-centric approach to modeling and reasoning about various interconnected problem domains. Maana solutions generally follow a simple pattern:

* Observe the problem domain.
* Reason over the problem domain to make \(explicable\) recommendations.
* Decide \(assist the user\) with what action to take.
* Learn from the outcome of the decision in order to make better recommendations

#### Real World Examples <a id="real-world-examples"></a>

Real world examples of the knowledge solutions we provide to you might include the following examples:

1. Given a set of invoices, what is the optimal collection plan?
2. Given a set of malware victims, who are the most vulnerable likely victims?
3. Given a patient history and a patient condition, what is the most relevant history?
4. Given a set of Bitcoin wallets, what are the most likely fraudulent transactions?
5. Given a customer equipment failure, what is the recommended repair action?
6. Given a set of insurance claims, which are most likely fraudulent?
7. Given a job activity, what are the relevant Health & Safety considerations?

**Composing** and **Reusing** Models and Solutions offers you, the Maana end user:
