# Maana Kinds

##  Understanding Maana Kinds <a id="understanding-maana-kinds"></a>

Kinds are the term that Maana uses for the data types used to build their Knowledge Graphs. These "concepts" may contain fields containing Properties, Instances with Values \(measurements of size, numbers, etc.\) for Entities within them, and the Relationships \(connections/dependencies\) to other Kinds.

| **Term** | **Definition** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kinds** | Kinds are concepts. | People, ships, Oil wells, Invoices |
| **Fields** | Properties within a concept | Example - Fields related to People: age, sex, height, weight, etc. |
| **Instances** | Values for entities within a concept | Example - People Instance: Paul Smith, adult male, blond, right-handed, married. |
| **Values** | A particular size, measure or number within an entity | Example - Values for Paul: 40 yrs old, 180 lbs., 10E shoe size, 6'2". |
| **Relations** | Connections/dependencies that can be established between fields of different Kinds | Married to Linda Smith, related to family name Smith. |

The data generally found in Kinds falls into three categories

1. **Raw Data Kinds**
2. **Interpreted Data Kinds**
3. **Manually Created Kinds**

#### Interpreted Data Kinds <a id="interpreted-data-kinds"></a>

Interpreted Data Kinds are generated from Raw Data Kinds following being parsed by Maana Bots/Microservices.​
