# Creating a Workspace

###  Creating a Workspace

As we mentioned earlier, your Workspace is the key to utilizing the Computational Knowledge Graph \(CKG\) and unlocking the power of the Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) data stream.  If you are not using an existing Workspace, you will want to create one of your own.  This can be done in a few rapid steps.

* First, select the **Workspaces** **Tab** at the top of your **Maana Portal** screen.

Select the blue circle with the "**+**" icon in it located in the upper left of your screen \(see example above\).  Your screen should now display a new Workspace that you have created, named **Untitled**, similar to the one shown in the example found below.

**Note**:  To close your Workspace, select the "-" button located in the upper right corner of your screen.
{% endhint %}

Selecting the icon for the **Untitled** Workspace will open a secondary menu bar, where you can name your new Workspace, and decide if you wish to make it Public using the **Context** Panel on the right of your screen \(see example below\).

The various areas in the Workspaces Tab screen are:

#### The Explorer Panel

This area contains inventories of Knowledge Graphs \(KGs\), Raw Data Kinds, and Interpreted Kinds \(refer to example provided below\).

**Explorer Panel** activities include:

* Creating a new Knowledge Graph.
* Querying a Knowledge Graph.
* Uploading a file or groups of files into the Workspace.
* Removing a Knowledge Graph from your Workspace.

#### The Inventory Panel

**Inventory Panel** activities include:

* Creating a New Knowledge Graph using the listed **Services**.
* Querying a Knowledge Graph using the listed **Services**.
* Uploading a file or group of files into the Workspace from the listed **Services**.
* Removing a Knowledge Graph from the Workspace.

#### The Visualization Panel

Lists within the Visualization Panel include **Instances**, **Entities** and **Values** for **Raw Data Kinds** and **Interpreted Kinds**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**:  A search-as-you-type filter is available for each Entity.
{% endhint %}

**Visualization Panel** activities include:

* Visualization of the **Kinds** and **Data** associated with other Kinds - such as Instances, Entities and Values.

#### The Context Panel

Use the **Context Panel** to create Kind names, Property Toggles and edit Schema.  You may also suggest Inbound and Outbound Relations \(hasKind\) to Interpreted Kinds in this location.

**Context Panel** activities include:

* **Information Tab** - Modification or deletion of Kinds or their properties.

* **Relations Tab** - Creation of relationships between Kinds or Entities within Kinds.

* **Text Mining Tab** \(Doc Assist©️\) - Used for document classification.

#### The Canvas Area

The **Canvas Area** offers the user the ability visualize Knowledge Graphs, Kinds and Relations.  In addition, you can manually add, remove or clone a Kind  in this location - as well as auto-arranging or viewing the entire Graph.  You man also reset the Workspace appearance from this area.

**Canvas Area** activities include:

* Drag-and-Drop files to create or enhance an existing Knowledge Graph.
* Creation or Deletion of Kinds.
* Curate existing Kinds, and the connections between Kinds.
* Visualize and manually explore the Knowledge Graph.
